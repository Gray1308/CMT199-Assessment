                <h1>Reflection on Learning</h1>
                <p>This module taught me mainly the fundamentals of HTML & CSS programming on the technical side, but
                    more importantly than
                    that it also taught me about computation and the problem-solving methods enabled through
                    computational thinking. Prior
                    to this, I had tried my hand at front-end development due to a strong interest in the subject. I had
                    simply implemented
                    a personal blog myself, but later gave up on maintaining it due to other academic pressures. This
                    module has rekindled
                    my interest in the web and has taught me a skill I hadn't mastered before - using selectors! This
                    technique has reduced
                    my development time considerably and the structure of the CSS files is much clearer and easier to
                    adjust and maintain
                    the site structure later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to this, the ability to master computational thinking is a huge advantage of this
                    module! As I gradually
                    learned more and more about the world of programming, I realised the importance of computational
                    thinking. Computational
                    thinking is arguably the cornerstone of all programming methods today, and this step-by-step
                    cognitive strategy is very
                    beneficial to my learning at the moment. We all know that JAVA and Python are both object-oriented
                    programming languages
                    and that the abstract concepts of 'classes' and 'inheritance' make it difficult for beginners to
                    understand and master
                    them. But through computer thinking, we can think more critically and creatively. We can also adapt
                    ourselves to the
                    logic of abstract thinking and gradually find real solutions. This knowledge is invaluable for
                    future learning of the
                    flask framework and for future career planning. Through computer thinking, through programming
                    languages, we can create
                    the world we want!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last but not least, computer thinking has given me the ability to learn by example. That is, the
                    ability to generalise
                    problems and to generalise a class of problems. It helps me to develop the ability to continue
                    learning, to try to solve
                    complex problems from multiple angles and even to come up with new problems. The focus and
                    perseverance I have acquired
                    from this will be the golden key to my future studies and work! Of course it has also taught me the
                    ability to transfer
                    learning, such as cross-disciplinary inspiration, using models from one domain and improving them to
                    solve problems in
                    another domain in a targeted way. These are higher-order competencies that require sweat and luck.
                    Computational
                    thinking can be applied to almost any job and any industry. Having the ability to solve problems,
                    analyse critically,
                    communicate and think creatively, and to go beyond current methods of behaviour in future careers as
                    well as in
                    learning, is priceless in our competitive and ever-changing digital world.
