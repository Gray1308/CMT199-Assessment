                <p>Alan Turing (1912-1954)</p>
            </div>
            <p>If you want to describe Turing and his life in the simplest words, you only need three words: <span
                    class="text-primary">war hero</span>, <span class="text-primary">homosexual</span>, and <span
                    class="text-primary">creator</span> (of computer science).</p>
            <p>Winston Churchill once recorded in his memoirs that "Turing, as the hero who decippped the Enigma
                cipher machine, made
                the greatest contribution to the eventual success of the Allies in winning the Second World War."
            </p>
            <p>Not only that, but Turing's brilliant achievements in mathematics and logic also set the grand
                blueprint for the
                development of modern computing, and the digital age in general. In recognition of his pioneering
                contributions, the
                Turing Award, named after him - the Nobel Prize of computing - was officially established in 1966 as
                the highest award
                in the field.</p>
            <p>People usually only know him as a scientist, but they don't know that he was actually a world-class
                long-distance
                runner. Turing's best marathon time was 2 hours 46 minutes, only 11 minutes slower than his 1948
                Olympic gold medal
                time. In a 10,000m race at an international track and field meet, he beat Richards, the Olympic
                silver medallist of the
                same year. Turing put a lot of effort into practising his long-distance running and finally reached
                world level.</p>
            <P>Despite his extremely distinguished scientific contributions, he was given two options after his public
                trial and
                conviction because of his sexual orientation: prison or estrogen injection therapy (i.e. chemical
                castration). He
                finally opted for estrogen injections, which lasted for a year. During this time, the drug produced side
                effects
                including growing breasts, and also took a great toll on Turing, who had loved sport, both physically
                and mentally.</P>
            <p>It may be that whenever we speak of Turing and the England that he saved, we cannot avoid remembering
                the darker side of
                history - the damage that people's arrogance and prejudice did to themselves echoing in our ears for
                decades like the
                chimes of Big Ben - but that is why we need to look at history and the contribution that those
                brilliant men and women
                made to humanity and use it as a lesson to ensure that civilisation does not lose its moral and
                human reins along the
                way.</p>

                <p>To this day, his proposal for a universal Turing machine - an abstract computer that enables
                    multitasking by changing
                    software - has been affirmed as the precursor to contemporary computers, with common "ancestors"
                    from the earliest
                    cathode arrays to the various laptops we use today. Arguably, almost all of the later initial
                    models, and even the
                    earliest software and programs put into use, from the early Army's ENIAC electronic numerically
                    integrated computer to
                    Princeton's EDVAC to the ACE, were built on Turing's then little-known papers!</p>

                <p>Although Turing himself built up the entire field of computer science almost single-handedly through
                    the intelligent
                    machines he created, he kept asking a question that even he had difficulty answering: how to define
                    this new generation
                    of "intelligence" that he created? What is it? What will it become? What are its possibilities? It
                    was not until 1950
                    that his famous paper "Computer Mechanics and Intelligence" was published, which for the first time
                    ever introduced the
                    concept of "artificial intelligence", as well as the equally well known "imitation game" and the
                    "The Turing Test, which
                    was designed to determine whether computers would one day become like humans and actually think, and
                    be able to fool
                    those who ask them questions into thinking that the conversation is a human-to-human one.</p>
