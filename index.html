                <h1>What is computer thinking?</h1>
                <p>Computational thinking is the way of thinking by computer scientists, which underlies the bodies of
                    knowledge in the
                    computer science discipline. Computer science provides an intellectual foundation supporting the
                    information technology
                    industry, the worldwide digital economy and the information society.
                </p>
                <h1>What is my understanding of computational thinking?</h1>
                <p>Computational thinking is the way of thinking and the behaviour of people who think and analyse
                    problems, build models
                    and solve problems by using knowledge and concepts from computer disciplines. Computational thinking
                    is a way of
                    thinking that computer science students must master, but it is not unique to those studying or
                    working in computer
                    science; everyone should learn and apply this way of thinking. Computational thinking is much more
                    than just programming
                    computer programs; it requires us to think at different levels of abstraction. It is a computational
                    concept that we use
                    to think and solve problems, to deal with relationships and to live our daily lives.
                </p>
                <h1>The importance of computational thinking</h1>
                <p><b>In learning</b>, the practice of computational thinking can help students develop the ability to
                    continue learning, to try
                    to solve complex problems from multiple perspectives, and even to ask new questions. In today's
                    society, which tends to
                    deliver information and short term solutions too quickly, mastering computational thinking can help
                    us to solve problems
                    more efficiently, make more attempts, and become focused and persistent in our learning, which are
                    elements of the
                    skills students should have.
                </p>
                <p>At the same time, computational thinking can be applied to any function of a commercial business or
                    public service. The
                    ability to solve problems, analyse critically, communicate and think creatively, and to think beyond
                    current methods of
                    behaviour, are priceless skills in our competitive and ever-changing digital world.</p>
                <p>Computational thinking runs through every aspect and function of a modern business, and it is
                    <b>beneficial to careers</b> in
                    virtually every sector, including consumer products, business and financial markets, energy, travel
                    and tourism, or
                    public services such as healthcare, education and law and order. Workplaces need employees to take
                    an active role in
                    thinking problems through and creating solutions. It has become more crucial in the 21st-century
                    workplace where so much
                    is now data-driven - analysing consumer behaviour, the movement in financial markets and the
                    performance of public
                    services, like health or policing, are just a few job roles that require. individuals to be able to
                    think through
                    problems in a way that a computer could understand.
                </p>
                <p>Even if someone is not then in a position to create a solution using programming languages and
                    computers, being able to
                    understand and think through business problems using computation concepts is vital.</p>
